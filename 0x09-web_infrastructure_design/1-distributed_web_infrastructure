Distributed Web Infrastructure (Task 2) - Diagram Description

1. User's Browser
   - The user enters www.foobar.com in their web browser.

2. DNS
   - Resolves the domain name to the Load Balancer's IP address.

3. Load Balancer (HAProxy)
   - Receives incoming requests from users.
   - Distributes them between two application servers using a load balancing algorithm (e.g., Round Robin).
   - Helps improve performance and fault tolerance.

4. Server 1: Nginx + Application Server
   - Serves static content (HTML, CSS, JS) via Nginx.
   - Passes dynamic requests to the application server (running backend code).
   - Handles write operations to the Primary database.
   - Can also perform read operations from the Replica database.

5. Server 2: Nginx + Application Server
   - Identical setup to Server 1.
   - Processes requests from the Load Balancer.
   - Handles write operations to the Primary database.
   - Can also perform read operations from the Replica database.

6. MySQL Primary Database (Write)
   - Stores all application data.
   - Handles all INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations.
   - Replicates data to the Replica database.

7. MySQL Replica Database (Read)
   - Receives replicated data from the Primary database.
   - Handles read-only queries to reduce load on the Primary database.

Data Flow:
User Browser → DNS → Load Balancer → (Server 1 or Server 2) → MySQL Primary (for writes) / MySQL Replica (for reads).
